My love, know I'm in for the long ride (in for the long ride)
I'm not playing games of the wrong kind
Could be keeping secrets and telling lies
But I'm just online, and I can promise you
I'll never play ya, I'll find a way to
Show you I'm grateful, so I'm begging you
Two minutes only, you'll get a trophy
I'm staying faithful
It's me and the PS5
Tell me why you making me decide (yeah)
Please, don't you see I'm live? (I'm live)
So if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over
Me and the PS5
Least you know where I'ma be at night (yeah)
Score's never been this high (so high)
So if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over
Me or the PS5
Me or the PS5
Me or the PS5
